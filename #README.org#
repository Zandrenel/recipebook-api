* Mealplan API


** Running It
- Make sure you're in the src folder in the cli
- run scryer-prolog server.pl
  - this will consult the server.pl file
- once in the file run ?- server(3030).
  - this will run the server on port 3030, any port can be used    

** Folder Structure
** src/
- this is where the toplevel is of the code
- the main execute is here as well as other code that may need to be toplevel

** src/modules
- this is where each pl file for each base route should be
- example being all mealplan routes should be in the mealplan file and will start with /mealplan/X

** Known Issues/To Check
- [-] Get other types of requests working except just get requetss
  - [X] GET
  - [X] POST
  - [ ] PATCH
  - [ ] DELETE
- [ ] Make sure the pio library fully works and so does reading from file
- the `/mealplans/basic` route is broken right now but can be fixed

** Recipes
*** Recipe attributes
- name
- author?
- ingredients[]
  - quanity
  - measurement
  - ingredient name
- yield?
- type: meat|pescatarian|vegetarian|vegan
*** Recipe notes
- not all information needs to be hardcoded
  - example:
    - pescatarian can be a predicate, it checks the ingredients in a recipe, and declares a recipe as so if no ingredient is meat is meat besides fish, just needs a knowledge base of ingredients and naming if they're fish, vegtables, meat, other
